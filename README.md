Project Overview

Welcome to my GitHub repository! 🚀 This project delves into the realm of deep learning, specifically focusing on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and their application to the CIFAR-10 image classification task. 🖼️ As a mechanical engineering student with a fervent interest in Robotics and AI, and having recently completed the "Deep Neural Networks with PyTorch" course, my objective was to translate acquired knowledge into a practical challenge.

Objectives and Learnings

Training my own deep learning models has exposed me to a plethora of challenges, ranging from basic to advanced, in both theory and implementation. 💡 This journey has been instrumental in enhancing my coding proficiency, leveraging well-known libraries, and discerning the most suitable methods and parameters for effective model training and evaluation.

Key Skills

Programming(python) 💻
Deep learning 🧠
MATLAB 🛠️
