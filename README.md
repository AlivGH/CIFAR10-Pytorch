Project Overview

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This project delves into the realm of deep learning, specifically focusing on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and their application to the CIFAR-10 image classification task. As a mechanical engineering student with a fervent interest in Robotics and AI, and having recently completed the "Deep Neural Networks with PyTorch" course, my objective was to translate acquired knowledge into a practical challenge.

Objectives and Learnings

Training my own deep learning models has exposed me to a plethora of challenges, ranging from basic to advanced, in both theory and implementation. This journey has been instrumental in enhancing my coding proficiency, leveraging well-known libraries, and discerning the most suitable methods and parameters for effective model training and evaluation.
